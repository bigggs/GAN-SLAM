# GAN-SLAM

## Status: ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

Welcome to **GAN-SLAM**: Automated occupancy grid cleaning for floor plan creation using SLAM with error correction and artefact removal.

This repository is currently under construction and will be completed shortly. Stay tuned for updates as we will be adding all relevant code, datasets, models, and ROS packages soon.

## Project Overview
GAN-SLAM leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to clean and enhance occupancy grid maps produced by SLAM, correcting errors and removing artefacts in real-time. This improves the quality of 2D floor plans and maps, particularly in large-scale, complex environments.

## Repository Contents (Coming Soon):
- **Dataset**: A dataset to train the GAN model for SLAM error correction and artefact removal.
- **Trained Model**: Pre-trained GAN model for enhancing occupancy grid mapping results.
- **ROS Package**: For real-time inference in ROS (Robot Operating System).
- **ROS2 Package**: For real-time inference in ROS2, enabling enhanced SLAM integration.

## Features
- Real-time occupancy grid cleaning
- Error correction for SLAM maps
- Artefact removal for improved floor plan creation
- Integration with both ROS and ROS2

## Coming Soon:
- Detailed project description
- Installation instructions
- Usage guidelines
- Example scripts and demos
- Contributions guidelines
- License information

Thank you for your patience! Feel free to follow this repository for updates.
